# Pi-car-Behavioural-cloning
Built an autonomous pi-car using Raspberry Pi microprocessor to detect the track from the images supplied by a pi-cam and adjust steering angle and the motor speed to keep the car on the track.
Implemented Convolutional Neural Network model inspired from End to End Learning for Self-Driving Cars paper by NVIDIA for this purpose and trained model using open source by Udacity self- driving car.
Used data augmentation and preprocessing techniques and obtained validation loss of 0.03.
